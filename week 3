what is an economic base 
  interested in exports
    exports bring in revenues
    revenues are a source of growth- income, output, employment
    
    EB theory about what makes a region/economy grow
 
 Today interested in economic base theory and employment. 
 
 can measure economic activity using employment, output, wages
 
 T = sum of all employment, output wages. Lets just say for now its employment
 T = Basic + Nonbasic               total employment is split into basic sector and nonbasic sector where the basic sector is the exporting sector and the nonbasic is like services and shit
 
 Assumption: there is a ratio btwn basic and nonbasic jobs. In order to grow the basic employment and shit, gotta grow the nonbasic shit.
         1893, riverside cnty was the richest in the nation because of CITRUS 
         in order to produce more CITRUS, farmers need more NONBASIC support to support BASIC goods - land, labor, equipment, infrastructure
         
  Let us assume that the ratio is fixed. N/B = g
                                          N = gB
                  Since T = B + N         T = B + gB
                                          T = B (1 + g) where (1 + g) is an ECONOMIC BASE MULTIPLIER saying that for every basic job you need some # nonbasic job
                                          
  EB theory focuses on the basic sector BUT bakes in assumptions of Nonbasic importance
 
 e.g. N = 400,000
      B = 600,000
      T = 1,000,000
      
      g = N/B = 6/4 = 1.5
      multiplier = 1+g = 2.5
